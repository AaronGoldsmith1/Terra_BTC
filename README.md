#Terra BTC
##Find the average cash price of Bitcoin by location

####In-Person cash-based transactions for buying and selling bitcoins is an effective alternative to transacting in online exchanges.  Advantages to real-world transactions include:
* No need to divulge sensitive personal information such as SSN, ID, address, bank account etc.
* Less risk for fraud or theft as individuals remain in direct control of their Bitcoin.
* No formal processing delays.
* No bank or credit card fees.
* No risk of 3rd party service outages/hacks.


####The main resource for these in-person transactions has been a serverice called localbitcoins.com, which maintains a directory of buyers and sellers who can post their offers at whichever price they please.

####However, the prices listed on localbitcoins often significantly deviates from averages of leading online exchanges, such as Coindesk's 'Bitcoin Price Index (XBP), which 'is intended to serve as a standard retail price reference for industry participants and accounting professionals.'  Offers for a particular location will also significantly vary from merchant to merchant.

####Terra BTC will calculate the average, max, and minimum buying and selling price for cash merchants on localbitcoins, so that users will be better informed upon making financial decisions.  Furthermore, Terra BTC would be of particular interest to users who are travelling or relocating between locations in which bitcoin prices significantly differ.

####There would also be implications for online or local commercial merchants who accept bitcoin as a form of payment, so that they might be able to know how much of a premium (or potentially a discount) to place on transactions conducted in Bitcoin based on where purchases are being made.
